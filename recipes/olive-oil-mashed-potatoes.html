            <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salt for boiling water, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
                <li>3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add peeled and quartered potatoes to a sauce pan. Cover with cold water by at least 1 inch. Season with salt and garlic, and bring to a boil on medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until potatoes are very soft, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add back into the pot or into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until very smooth. Switch to a whisk or electric hand mixer, and whip in the olive oil in two additions.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt; serve with more olive oil drizzled over the top if desired.</li>
            </ol>
